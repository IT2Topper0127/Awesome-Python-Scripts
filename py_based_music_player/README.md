# Web Based Music Player , Update Music Using Python

-> Web based ( HTML, CSS , JS) based Music player, but instead of manually changing and adding music use python to do that.

-> Cause without Database it is very hard to maintain this offline music player,

### How to use

-> add your music into assets > music > <create_music_folder> / music files

-> each folder in assets > music will act as playlist.

-> for each music add it's relevant art cover .jpg files into assets > cover > <that_same_folder> / music file cover (with the same name as your relevant  .mp3 file).

-> add album cover into assets > cover > album_cover folder.

-> Now Run `python py_based_music_player.py`

-> this will update the .js file of music data and use can open music.html to see the changes.

### Note

-> On first load their is default folder > which contains music to launch on first start,

you can change that also.
